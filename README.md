# BK-automate-boring-stuff-python-projects
Completed projects from the book 'Automate the boring stuff with python, 2nd Edition' by Al Sweigart.

I have worked on these projects during December 2020 - January 2021, on a MacBook Pro running Catalina 10.15.7. 

Please keep this in mind when reading the below comments, as certain issues came up for me because of python libraries changing or issues with running things on a MacBook. You may not run into the same issues yourself, depending on your setup.

The following projects are not included in this repo:

## Chapter 6
__Zombie Dice Bots:__ Didn't want to deal with getting the game itself

## Chapter 12
__All projects:__ I wanted to avoid using selenium and have enough experience in web scraping that I really wanted to avoid doing more in my spare time.

## Chapter 14
__ALl projects:__ Couldn't get a connection to Google Drive going.

## Chapter 18
__Auto Unsubscriber:__ Issues with IMAP, and I didnâ€™t want to mess with my inbox or setup a new one with dummy emails in it.
__Controlling Your Computer Through Email:__ Wanted to leave my email alone and not install BitTorrent.

## Chapter 20
__Using the Clipboard to Read a Text Field:__ Key features did not work on a Mac.
__Instant Messenger Bot:__ Didn't want to use my actual social media accounts to test, and didn't want to setup test accounts just for this project.
